#
#	The following table is used to configure rules that specify which network
#	hosts are allowed to bypass the filtering checks when connected.
#
#	The reason this is even needed, is if this MTA is an inbound and outbound
#	relay MTA. Assuming that you trust all outbound traffic, you don't want to
#	do any filter checks for oubound traffic.
#
#	The amount, or lack of white space is not significant.
#
#	The fields are;
#	action		|	match address		|	exception address
#	allow or deny	|	address, address, ...	|	empty or address, address, ...
#
#	allow = Do NOT run filter tests, for "address" other than those specified by "excpetion"
#	deny = DO run filter tests, for "address" other than those specified by "excpetion"
#
#	The ``match addrress'' and ``exception address'' fields are meant to have one, or possibly
#	more, ipv4 or ipv6 network address and netmask specifications, that are comma spearated.
#	They must be listed in CIDR form only. ie. 192.168.0.0/16, not 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
#
#	It is invalid to mix ipv4 and ipv6 address spcecifications on the same row
#
#	Valid addresse sytax is anything that is recognized by the systems inet_pton() function.
#
#	The examples listed here, are contrived, and in no way suggest what should,
#	or shouldn't be included or excluded for the local site, but rather, they are
#	meant to show valid syntax examples.
#
#	--- examples --
#	An ipv4, allow single host example
#	allow		|	10.1.2.3/32		|
#
#	An ipv4, allow every thing in /16 except /24
#	allow		|	192.168.0.0/16		|	192.168.10.0/24
#
#	An ipv4, allow everything example	
#	allow		|	0.0.0.0/0		|
#
#	An ipv6, allow everyting example
#	allow		|	::0/0			|
#	--- end of examples ---
#
#	One problem that the previous hard coded behavior didn't account for, was a dual homed
#	host whose public interface was NAT'd. Now, that type of configuration can be correctly
#	dealt with here, buy excluding the public NAT network.
#
#	The primary reason that the hard coded address were moved into this config file, is to
#	handle the wildly varying plethora of ipv6 addresses on a given interface, and "knowing"
#	which one were private vs. public. ie. an fe80:: address can, technically, be a public
#	facing interface.
#
#	You probably want this one, or a variation of it, as it emulates the previous hard coded
#	behavoir.
	allow	|	10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16	|
#
#	Note: That, 127.0.0.1 and ::1 are hard coded as ``allow'', and are therefore not, listed here.
#	Adding them, will likely result in unexpected behavior, so just don't!
#
#	For those of you who used ifilocal.inc, you should replicate the your equivialent lnh[] entries here.
